# Pascal's Triangle
#
# Pascal's Triangle is a triangle where all numbers are the sum of the two numbers above it. Here's an example of the Pascal's Triangle of size 5.
#     1
#    1 1
#   1 2 1
#  1 3 3 1
# 1 4 6 4 1
#
# Given an integer n, generate the n-th row of the Pascal's Triangle.
#
# Here's an example:
# print(pascal_triangle_row(6))
# [1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1]


def pascal_triangle_row(n):
  row = [1] * n
  for i in range(n):
    last = row[0]
    for j in range(1, i):
        temp = row[j]
        row[j] = last + row[j]
        last = temp
  return row


print(pascal_triangle_row(5))
