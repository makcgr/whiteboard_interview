Given a node in a binary search tree (may not be the root), find the next largest node in the binary search tree (also known as an inorder successor). The nodes in this binary search tree will also have a parent field to traverse up the tree.

NOTE: Inorder Successor of an input node in BST can also be defined as the node with the smallest key greater than the key of the input node.

E.g.

      5 
    /   \
   3     7
  / \   / \
 2   4 6   9

inorder_successor(tree.right):
