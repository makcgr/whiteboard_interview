Search in a 2D matrix I, II


Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an (m x n) integer matrix. This matrix has the following properties: 
- integers in each row are sorted from left to right

I 
- the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Example:
 1,  3,  5,  7
 10, 11, 18, 20
 23, 30, 31, 35


II
- integers in each column are sorted from top to bottom.

Example:
 1,  4,  7,  11
 2,  5,  8,  12
 3,  6,  9,  16
 10, 13, 14, 17
